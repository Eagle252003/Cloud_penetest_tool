# Cloud_penetest_tool
This project is focused on exploring security risks, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP). It provides hands-on scripts, methodologies, and test cases that can be used in authorized penetration testing or educational labs.  


Features

🔍 Cloud Reconnaissance – Enumerate services, storage, IAM roles, and endpoints

🛡️ Misconfiguration Detection – Check for common misconfigurations in storage, networking, and permissions

⚡ Exploitation Simulations – Demonstrate potential attack paths in a controlled environment

📊 Reporting Framework – Generate summaries of findings

🧪 Lab Setup Guides – Practice cloud pentesting in safe, isolated environmentscloud-pentesting/
